# Nuclear-Throne-Together-APworld
Manual AP World, YAML, and Complimentary Mod for Nuclear Throne Together.

Completely functional, but Lacking alot of polish, YAML options, significant balance, or **any checks or locations regarding V100.**

You can play it, it'll function, but I'm planning on updating it to include V100 features (like cuz and C Skins), add new items, refine the balance and hopefully add yaml options.
If you do test it, let me know how It goes, feedback'll be appreciated!

Brave the wastelands, shoot monsters, defeat bosses, mutate, reach the nuclear throne, and loop past it. Clear loop 3 and enter loop 4 to complete your goal!

Intended Rules:
you start with 1 character and 1 mutation.
you'll have *half max health, half maximum ammo, and only be able to go up to level 2.*
items will be needed to go past level 2, and regain your lost max stats (and then some..)

You'll only be able to play the characters you have unlocked, and Don't start with crowns, unless you have vault access* [FOR NOW, UNTIL THE BALANCING IMPROVES]. You have no other restrictions.
